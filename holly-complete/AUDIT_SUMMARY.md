## 🎯 FEATURE SEPARATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### KEEP IN HOLLY (Personal AI Brain)

✅ Media generation (album covers, posts)  
✅ Goal & project management  
✅ Financial intelligence  
✅ Emotional intelligence  
✅ Code generation & deployment  
✅ Conversation & memory  
✅ Email template generation  

### MOVE TO SOUNDSTREAM (Music Platform)
🔴 Sync licensing finder (at scale)  
🔴 Playlist curator database (1000+ curators)  
🔴 Industry knowledge directory  
🔴 Revenue dashboard (multi-platform)  
🔴 Campaign management system  
🔴 Industry contacts CRM  
🔴 Web scrapers (infrastructure)
