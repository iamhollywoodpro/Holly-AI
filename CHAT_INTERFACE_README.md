## 🎯 How It Works

### **Message Flow:**
1. User types message → clicks send (or presses Enter)
2. Message appears in chat with user avatar
3. HOLLY shows typing indicator with "thoughtful" emotion
4. API processes message → detects context and emotion
5. HOLLY responds with animated message
6. Emotion indicator updates to match response

### **Emotion Detection:**
```typescript
// Examples:
"Let's build something!" → 🎯 Focused
"This is awesome!" → ✨ Excited  
"How does this work?" → 🧠 Thoughtful
"Haha that's fun!" → 💖 Playful
"Tell me more?" → 👁️ Curious
Default → ⚡ Confident
```
